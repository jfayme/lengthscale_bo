"""Conformer ensembles from RDKit embedding and MLIP relaxation (MACE-MH1).

Conformers are produced in four stages, each one cutting down the number of
structures handed to the next:

1. embedding with RDKit ETKDGv3, scaled to the rotatable bond count;
2. optimisation with a classical force field (MMFF94, falling back to UFF for
   elements MMFF has no parameters for);
3. clustering of the low-energy survivors on heavy-atom RMSD, keeping one
   representative per cluster;
4. relaxation of those representatives with a MACE machine-learned
   interatomic potential (MLIP), followed by duplicate minima removal.

Every tunable parameter is read from the `[conformer]` table of the settings
module.

The ensemble this module returns holds every unique minimum the search found,
up to the number of MLIP relaxations the settings allow

    ----------
    confs_per_rot_bond
        Conformers embedded per rotatable bond, before the cap below is
        applied; flexible molecules therefore get a larger starting pool.
    max_conformers
        Upper bound on the number of embedded conformers, whatever the
        flexibility of the molecule.
    seed
        Random seed handed to ETKDG.
    small_ring_torsions
        If True, ETKDG uses the torsion potentials fitted for small rings.
    prune_rms_thresh
        Embeddings closer than this RMSD (in Angstrom) are treated as
        duplicates and dropped as they are generated.
    n_threads
        Threads used by the RDKit routines; 0 uses every available core.
    max_iters
        Force-field optimisation steps allowed per conformer.
    mmff_window_kcal
        Only conformers within this energy of the force-field minimum (in
        kcal/mol) are considered for clustering.
    rmsd_cluster_thresh
        Butina cut-off (in Angstrom) on the heavy-atom RMSD, deciding which
        conformers count as the same shape.
    max_automorphisms
        Number of symmetry-equivalent atom mappings above which the
        clustering RMSD is measured on the molecule with stripped
        terminal atoms.
    pre_filter_conf_max
        Cap on the number of cluster representatives to be relaxed with MLIP.
    model_paths
        Path to the MACE weights to load. If None, cached mh-1 weights are
        reused, and downloaded first if the cache does not hold them.
    device
        Torch device the potential is evaluated on.
    head
        MACE output head selecting which trained target is predicted.
    default_dtype
        Floating-point precision the potential is evaluated at.
    enable_cueq
        If True, the cuEquivariance acceleration path is used.
    fmax
        Force convergence criterion for the BFGS relaxation, in
        eV/Angstrom.
    opt_steps
        Step budget for the BFGS relaxation of each conformer.
    log_every
        Relaxation progress is logged every this many conformers.
    dedup_energy_kcal
        Two relaxed minima closer than this in energy (in kcal/mol) are
        candidates for being the same structure.
    dedup_rmsd
        Two such candidates closer than this heavy-atom RMSD (in Angstrom)

    max_final
